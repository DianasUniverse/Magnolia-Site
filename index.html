					<p>Genie is a sensational new magnolia from New Zealand. After 15 years of breeding there is eventually a plant that holds its
						deep red-purple colour well and offers prolonged flowering period. The hybridizing process was truly awesome, if you are interested
						in how this jewel came to life follow its history of crossing:<br>
							Sweet Simplicity x liliiflora Nigra = Breeder<br>
							Breeder x Black Tulip = Sweet Valentine<br>
							Breeder x Sweet Valentine = Genie</p>
					<p>Genie has deep red, almost black buds that open into medium-sized flowers with 6-12 petals that open into 10-15 cm wide, cup-shaped,
					 	lotus-like flowers. It starts flowering in the middle of magnolia season and continues almost into summer when it offers a few extra
						flowers on the background of deep green, healthy foliage. It grows slowly about 3m tall and wide in a regular pyramidal shape. Genie
						flowers already as a two-year old seedling.</p>
					<p>Magnolias are not supposed to be pruned. You can prune old shrubs if ill, or trim them to shape or to reduce size, or make an
						elementary cut to young plants of unsightly or unhealthy appearance. Do this as soon as possible after flowering to secure setting
						of flower buds for the following year. Be aware that each magnolia can respond differently to pruning.</p>
					<p>Deciduous magnolias are quite easy plants. All they need is light, well-drained, acidic soil with equal moisture throughout the
						year. Once established they can do with occasional drought but will not look as nice as the ones with regular watering. Just pay
						attention to how to plant your magnolia. First, find it a spot where it will live forever and ever. It does not like transplanting.
						And as it makes shallow roots reaching well over its spread stay away from disturbing the roots by digging or messing about around
						it. Just cover the soil with bark mulch and do not plant anything else near it after say the second year after planting onwards. You
						could damage the very important top roots that absorb maximum moisture and nutrients from the soil. Also avoid planting magnolia too
						deep. Thus you could be digging its grave. It is fully hardy to -27°C and supposed to survive -29°C (USDA zone 5)</p>

				<p>One of the most unique aspects of the White Magnolia tree flower is its age! It is older than the bees! Always having been
					pollinated by beetles, the petals of the White Magnolia flower are super tough - enough to withstand all that beetle activity.
					The Magnolia species are around 95 million years old!</p>
				<p>There are many kinds of Magnolias, found mainly in two separate geographical areas: Asia and the Americas. The bark and flower
					buds of Magnolia officinalis have been used in traditional Chinese medicine, with a huge range of benefits. Japanese scientists
					have found constituents in Magnolia bark that are 1000 times more potent in antioxidant activity than Vitamin E, as well as being
					powerful anti-stress and cortisol-reducing (weight loss) remedies, restoring brain chemical balance and reducing inflammation.</p>
				<p>The Magnolia grandiflora is native to the Americas. It is HUGE, with creamy white petals and rich green leaves that have dark
					brown velvet on the undersides. This White Magnolia is supremely fragrant with a spicy floral scent.</p>

			<p>Alexandrina is a very popular variety of saucer magnolia. Thanks to the rich colour of outer petals it is rated commercially

			<p>Deciduous leaves are rather obovate with a notable tip, medium sized, mid to dark green. It grows moderately, 5-6m tall and 3-4m wide.

			<p>A small Magnolia with pale yellow flowers which appear mid to late Spring. One of the best things about this magnolia is its
				ability to adapt to various soil types, unlike other varieties it is tolerant of lime soil, so is suitable for almost any garden,
				due to its small nature it is also happy planted in a large pot so can be used for decoration in small gardens with no borders or
				planting area.</p>
			<p>Planting position: Magnolia Yellow Lantern prefer a good sunny spot but will cope well with light partial shade. Preferably plant
				somewhere away from exposed windy sites and somewhere that avoids frost as much as possible, this is more important in early spring
				than during the winter as late harsh late frosts may damage furry buds and the flowers.</p>
			<p>Soil: Whilst most Magnolia prefer an acidic soil. This variety will adapt to almost any type, even ones with a high lime content.
				Ensure the planting area has a good supply of water and does not dry out totally or become waterlogged.</p>
			<p>Suitable for container planting: Yes can adapt to being grown in a pot.</p>
			<p>Eventual height and spread: In absolute ideal conditions upto 3 metres with an 2 metres spread. But even after 10 years this
				plant will only have reached 1.5 metres</p>
			<p>Pruning: Not really a necessity, if you choose to it should be done in Mid-summer when the tree is in full leaf. Any broken
				or damaged branches can be removed as they occur. Growth speed: Slow</p>
			<p>Growth Habit: Bushy</p>
			<p>Evergreen: No deciduous Flowering Period: Produces pale yellow flowers in mid to late Spring, leaves arrive towards the end
				of the flowering period Foliage: Mid to dark green large leaves.</p>
			<p>Winter hardy: Yes</p>
			<p>A relatively easy plant to maintain, that has no real specific requirements. When preparing your hole add some well rotted
				manure or a loam based compost this will help the plant adapt to its new surroundings quicker, also ensure your plant is planted
				at the same depth as it is in the pot. Like all new plants ensure a good water supply until established</p>
